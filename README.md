# SpotifyToGmusic
Some scripts and tools to help convert spotify playlists to google music


Inspired by the awesome page here: http://everynoise.com/

But I dont pay for spotify premium (have a shared google account with music, so I wanted to listen to the full playlists on spotify, using my gmusic account)

Spotify library documentation: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Gmusic library docoumentation: https://unofficial-google-music-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

If people end up using this/want more features, just add an issue/feature request and I'll throw something together :)

But this should be a nice place to start.
